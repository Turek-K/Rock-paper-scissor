# Rock-paper-scissor

Rock, paper and scissors game
In the rock, paper and scissors game the goal is to create a command-line game where a user has the option to choose between rock, paper and scissors.The program also selects randomly one of the three options. Then the program adds the point to the computer or a player (if someone is the winner) and displays actual scores. The user  is asked if he wants to play again or not.

Hints:

At the beginning create a list with all options (rock, paper and scissors as strings). Then you can choose one of the options randomly using the code:
choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
computer = random.choice(choices)

Remember that in python ‘Paper’ is not the same as ‘paper’.
